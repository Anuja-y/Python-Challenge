**Analyzing Financial Records and Election Data with Python**

I have developed a Python script that offers comprehensive analysis of financial records and election data, demonstrating my proficiency in data manipulation and analysis. The script provides valuable insights for businesses and political campaigns, making it a valuable asset to potential employers.


**For the PyBank project, the script accomplishes the following:**


Determines the total number of months included in the dataset, giving a clear overview of the timeframe covered.
Calculates the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, providing a snapshot of the financial performance.
Computes the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and calculates the average of those changes, helping identify trends and patterns.
Identifies the greatest increase in profits, including the specific date and the corresponding amount, enabling strategic decision-making.
Identifies the greatest decrease in profits, highlighting the date and amount, which is crucial for risk assessment and mitigation.


**In the PyPoll project, the script delivers the following:**


Determines the total number of votes cast, offering a comprehensive view of the voter turnout.
Compiles a complete list of candidates who received votes, providing transparency in the electoral process.
Calculates the percentage of votes each candidate won, giving insights into the popularity of each candidate.
Determines the total number of votes each candidate received, providing a clear comparison of their support.
Declares the winner of the election based on popular vote, identifying the candidate with the highest number of votes and consolidating the results.


**RESOURCES:**

To develop these projects, I utilized various resources such as YouTube tutorials, educational websites like w3schools.com, learnpython.com, geeksforgeeks.org, flexiple.com, and simplilearn.com. These resources demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

I am more than willing to provide further information upon request. Please feel free to contact me for any additional details.
